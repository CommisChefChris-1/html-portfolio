    <h1>About Me</h1>

            <hr />
    
    <p>
        With over 20 years in the kitchen, I’ve mastered more than just cooking.
        My journey from leading teams in fast-paced culinary environments to founding Savor the Passion
        has given me a deep understanding of efficient workflows, process optimization,
        and the art of training staff to excel quickly.
        I’ve spent over a decade focusing on building systems that streamline operations,
        allowing teams to work smarter, not harder, and ensuring consistent growth and quality.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As I transition from the culinary world into tech,
        I’m excited to bring my passion for problem-solving and efficiency to new challenges.
        I thrive on creating processes that make life easier for others,
        whether that’s in a kitchen or through innovative technology.
        My experience in founding Savor the Passion, where I brought chefs into homes across the country,
        has fueled my desire to continue sharing knowledge and providing value—this time, in the tech space.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I’m particularly drawn to robotics, but I’m open to any opportunity that allows me to tackle difficult problems
        and contribute to meaningful, lifestyle-enhancing solutions.
        I’m a chef at heart—one who believes that work should be both fun and effective,
        and that success comes from a combination of creativity, dedication, and a well-prepared plan.
    </p>
